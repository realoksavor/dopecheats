An open source solution for bad aim in dahood, Roblox.

Please don't skid this, atleast give credit ;D
I've been working on this silent aim for around 2 months and It'd be greatly appreicated if you could star this repo.
I was going to make this paid but I could not bother adding proper security, so I'm just making it open-sourced. Go ahead, skid it. ATLEAST give print credit. All I'm asking for is something like: print("aimlock made by realoksavor")

Anyways, thanks. This is intended for dahood (https://www.roblox.com/games/2788229376/Da-Hood) BUT it MIGHT work for other games too.

Well enjoy skidding, playing, whatever your intentions are :D just if you skid without credit don't forget to feel bad.
